In this chapter, we will see how to create a database in MongoDB.

The use Command
MongoDB use DATABASE_NAME is used to create database. The command will create a new database if it doesn't exist, otherwise it will return the existing database.

Syntax
Basic syntax of use DATABASE statement is as follows −

use DATABASE_NAME
Example
If you want to create a database with name <mydb>, then use DATABASE statement would be as follows −

>use mydb
switched to db mydb
To check your currently selected database, use the command db

>db
mydb
If you want to check your databases list, use the command show dbs.

>show dbs
local     0.78125GB
test      0.23012GB
Your created database (mydb) is not present in list. To display database, you need to insert at least one document into it.

>db.movie.insert({"name":"tutorials point"})
>show dbs
local      0.78125GB
mydb       0.23012GB
test       0.23012GB
In MongoDB default database is test. If you didn't create any database, then collections will be stored in test database.
